quick answer/no context: question locked, still TONY 👦 is somebody really dedicated and he's giving itself 500% on a LOT of questions daily

question with consequences but no way to know what is actually hapenning without a more detailed reproduction or a github repo

also, some complaints about people being mean when they don't even know the answer, I never really saw this one tbh (people just don't answer), overall I don't feel like ego is getting in the way of helping others in the languages that I've watched. In case of a doubt, double check the tag points of the helper.

Comments are sometimes posted but they can be flagged too, if they're unkind.

---
downvotes: newcomers feel super bad when downvoted, even tho there is no real impact on it, try to improve the question to get it reopened or just skip it

helpers love to not spend 2 hours debugging something while the author just goes offline for 6 months (or forever)

---
coding service: here we have basically a "can you write that for me?" type of question.

It was indeed downvoted but it doesn't go worse than this one (one of the most downvoted of the platform for the past week) and the comments are still friendly and useful.

Not sure if some communities like JS/Vue are more welcome than Java/C++/etc...or if this was a former issue that is now solved.

Still, I never noticed some super aggressive answer. I guess those can happen but they will be deleted pretty fast anyway, thanks to the super active moderators! (and some machine learning, SO having several bots running that can help to semi-automate specific tasks)

---
quick answer: as we can see, the first line of the warning can be copy-pasted in the search bar of SO (with the nuxt tag even) to scope down the result.

The answer can also be found on Google, Brave Search and DuckDuckGo. The answer does have a lot of possible answers, links and detailed explanations.

Some answers got deleted there:
- deleted by the author itself, he probably thought that it was not really relevant
- 2 poors answers also got removed by the community to reduce the noise and provide only the best possible answers (with a minimal amount of effort)
- an answer which is not one really, but rather a "I have the same issue too" type of answer because the author could apparently not comment, available from 50 reputation tho

---
reputation: "damn, I cannot do anything on the website!"

[PRIVILEGES explanation], 100 reputation accross all stackexchanges when reached once. Safer to not grant too much privileges to newcomers too!

Cannot ban people with privileges, golden badge in a specific tag is powerful but is only for the duplication too, so yeah... 🤷‍♂️

---
opinion-based: "I want to create my own Tesla startup tomorrow, should I use Vue or React?"

those kind of questions are not allowed on SO, as it's written in the rules, so that people don't spend time arguing about things that are subjective

there are other places where people can ask for opinions, to name a few: reddit/facebook groups, github discussions, dedicated forums, discord, those may be more suited towards comparisons and pros/cons

Twitter is also a great place to ask people directly, some are super active like Kent C dodds (if you have any questions about Remix) or even [Simon Swiss](https://twitter.com/simonswiss) (Tailwind labs), that you can DM directly even if you're not friend with him

prefix the domains with chat like https://chat.vuejs.org/
