</p>

<p v-click>When you're almost desperate and out of ideas, feel free to post your question but to avoid those common reasons for a closing ⚠️: <i>duplicate, lacking details/focus, being opinion-based, asking for a tutorial/how-to, being related to another stack-exchange (hardware, networking, etc...)</i>.</p>


<p v-click>Here is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/70911055" target="_blank">an example</a> of a really well crafted question, let's analyze it together! 💪</p>

<p v-click>The more time is spent writing the question, the best and fastest answer it will receive! 🎊</p>

<!--

try to look for every possible google search that you can think of, read the documentation in detail, check a course or the tutorial in-depth, spend some time debugging overall, search on SO itself, and if you're still stuck after hours, feel free to post a question!

when writing your question, explain it to yourself: Rubber duck debugging is the best way to find a bug!

The more-precise, contextual, highlighted and scoped it'll be, the faster you'll get an answer!

good question review: it does have the good amount of tags, is not a duplicate, does have the relevant code properly highlighted (let's see how it's done), some links that shows that quite some effort was done upfront and also have details on the package versions.

on top of that, the author was responsive about his question and he also wrote himself a solution that suits his needs that he'll probably accept soon. this kind of question is always guaranteed to be really attractive and maximize the possibility for the best possible answer.

It doesn't even need to be further edited, it's already a really good question!
